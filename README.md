# COVID-19 Live Data ETL
This repository contains the code and Tableau workbook for live COVID19 data extraction from [John Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to create a [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/unnati7899#!/vizhome/Covid-19-Visualization/Dashboard) animated dashboard which updates daily.

The Python code requires credentials.json which has the access credentials to Google Sheets API - where the data is updated.
